              In 2021 I was introduced to Woz U as a school and how I could make
              my dreams a reality. I signed up for the Software Development
              program in July 2022 and had a ton of fun learning how to program
              and code. I finished in March 2023. Afterwards I kept learning
              more about Python on my own. Then in late September 2022 I signed
              up for the Cybersecurity program, with my background in software
              development I was able to better understand parts of the new
              program. I was able to successfully complete the cybersecurity
              program towards the end of July 2023. Now I want to take what Iâ€™ve
              learned and apply in in the field, as well as learning more
              everyday about cybersecurity.
